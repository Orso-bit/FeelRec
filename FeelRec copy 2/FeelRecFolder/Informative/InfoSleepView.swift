            Text("Sleep is a natural, recurring state of rest for the body and mind, during which consciousness is altered, sensory activity is reduced, and the body's systems undergo repair and restoration. It is essential for overall health and well-being, supporting physical and mental.\n\nBenefits of sleep include:\n\n1. Physical restoration: Sleep allows the body to repair tissues, muscles, and cells, and to strengthen the immune system.\n2. Cognitive function: Sleep enhances memory, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. It helps consolidate new information and improves focus and creativity.\n3. Emotional regulation: Adequate sleep helps regulate mood, reducing the risk of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n4. Hormonal balance: Sleep is important for hormone regulation, including hormones related to hunger, stress, and growth.\n5.
